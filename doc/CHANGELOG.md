# CHANGELOG for Mercury

## Version 2.5.19

* Improvements to `tls_scanner`, `batch_gcd`, and `cert_analyze`.
* Improved fuzz test coverage.
* Fixed minor typos and pluralization in JSON output.
* Portability changes to enable compilation (of some files) on Windows.

## Version 2.5.18

* Added experimental support for detecting and decoding Tofsee initial messages.  Use the option --nonselected-tcp-data to enable this feature.
* Added support for mySQL and MariaDB initial messages.
* Removed C-language comment from the LICENCE file.
* Fixed bug that caused DNS responses to sometimes be reported as queries.
* Improved cython support for building PIP packages.
* Extended the intercept library to detect and report on more protocol types.
* Increased the size of the internal data buffers in the intercept library to accomodate larger messages.
* Minor improvements to SMB2, IEC, SSDP, and documentation.
* Refactored some code for extensibility, code re-use, and clarity.

## Version 2.5.17

* Fixed a libmerc.so issue with extended configuration parsing.

## Version 2.5.16

* Fixed a libmerc.so issue with fingerprint format versions.

## Version 2.5.15

* Add support for the OpenVPN protocol over TCP; the `--select` command can be configured for that protocol with `openvpn_tcp`.
* Fixed an OpenSSL issue that would sometimes affect QUIC processing, by adding conditional compilation to handle older and newer versions of that library.  The ./configure script now sets the variable SSLNEW, when the required newer data structures are found.
* Refactored HTTP for improved performance.

## Version 2.5.14

* When --analysis is used, the TLS fingerprint format in the resource file is detected, and that format will be used to process packets.  The `--format` option, if present, will be overriden.

## Version 2.5.13

* Added `--format` option that selects the fingerprint format(s).
* Added `tls/1` fingerprint format, in which extensions are sorted into increasing lexicographic order.  This compensates for TLS clients that randomize the order of extensions.
* Updated and amended this README.

## Version 2.5.12

* Fixes some bugs.
* Updated and amended this README.

## Version 2.5.11

* Run-time configurability for Genric Routing Encapsulation (GRE), Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), NetBIOS Datagram Service (NBDS), NetBIOS Streaming Service (NBSS), Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), and the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).  These protocols are off by default; they must explicitly appear in the `--select` option to be selected.
* STUN and DNP3 introduce a new convention for reporting unknown type codes in JSON by including the hexadecimal value of the unknown code as a string, such as `"type":"UNKNOWN (0004)"`.  This convention allows for a smaller and simpler schema, since no additional fields are needed to report unknown values.
* Support for the [automatic generation of C++ classes that represent type codes](doc/autogen.md) from Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, in the [src/tables](src/tables) directory.  This facility is currently used by STUN and IKE.
* Experimental support for IKEv2.
* Fuzz tests now run in parallel, making that process considerably faster.  Additional fuzz tests were added.

## Version 2.5.10

* Fixes some bugs.
* Updated and amended this README.

## Version 2.5.9

* Support for detecting, parsing, and reporting STUN packets as JSON.  Fingerprinting for STUN is experimental.

## Version 2.5.8

* Added fuzz testing framework based on libfuzz.  This replaces AFL in the `make fuzz-test` target in `test/`.
* Support for on-demand TCP reassembly of TLS Client Hello packets and other metata.  This feature is configured with the --tcp-reassembly option.
* Support for detecting DNS over TCP packets and reporting that data in the JSON output.
* Support for detecting SMB v1 and v2 and reporting the fields of the negotiate request and response packets in the JSON output.
* Support of detecting IEC 60870-5-104 packets and reporting its fields in the JSON output.

## Version 2.5.7

* Support for detecting SSDP and reporting relevant fields in the JSON ouput.

## Version 2.5.6

* QUIC salt-guessing logic, to find the salt for unknown versions of that protocol.
* Support for parsing and reporting fields of NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) packets.
* Support for parsing and reporting fields of Multicast DNS (mDNS) packets.

## Version 2.5.5

* Experimental: initial pcap-ng parsing code.
* Initial microbenchmarking code to analyze pcap throughput.
* Telemetry enhancements: performance optimizations and new fields such as the libmerc version and initialization time.
* Added changes to prioritize packet filter config over STATIC_CFG_SELECT.

## Version 2.5.4

* Experimental: initial Android support for standalone mercury and cython integration.
* New option for time-based output file rotation.
* Telemetry bugfixes to address inconsistent data across telemetry files post-rotation.

## Version 2.5.3

* Added support for reading and processing different LINKTYPEs; ETHERNET, RAW (IP), and PPP are currently supported.
* Added TLS and QUIC ALPN and user-agent reporting into libmerc.h API.
* Updated IANA values and added support for Facebookâ€™s custom versions

## Version 2.5.2
* Improved QUIC fingerprinting.
* Added support for HTTP and QUIC process identification.
* Improved HTTP process identification by incorporating the User-Agent as additional context in the classifier.
* Separated the DTLS class from the TLS class, and moved it into its own [separate header file](src/libmerc/dtls.h).

## Version 2.5.1
* Extended the `stats` feature to report HTTP and QUIC metadata data, in addition to TLS data. Refactored the message queues to use tuples to serialise/deserialisze data features.
* IPv6 addresses are now reported in compressed format in the JSON output and `stats` output.
* Added  [libmerc_api.h](src/libmerc_api.h), a header-only C++ library that provides a clean interface into `libmerc.so`, and [libmerc_util](src/libmerc_util.cc), a test/example/driver program that dynamically loads a variant of that library.

## Version 2.5.0
* Replaced resource directory with resource archive.  A single compressed archive (or `.tar.gz`) file holds all of the resources that mercury needs in order to run its classifier.  The --resources command line option now specifies the path of the resources archive.  This change makes it easier to configure and distribute the set of resource files as an atomic set.  The archive format is a conventional Unix Standard tape archive format (as defined by POSIX in IEEE P1003.1-1988, and widely used through the GNU `tar` utility), compressed with GZIP (as defined by RFC1952, and widely used through `gzip` and `pigz`).
* Added the experimental `stats` feature, which computes and stores aggregate statistics regarding TLS fingerprints and destinations, and periodically writes those statistics out to a compressed JSON file.   The stats file output is independent from the normal session-oriented JSON output.  The number of stats entries can be limited in order to protect against memory exhaustion.  This feature is currently experimental, and is likely to evolve.  It uses these new command line options:

        --stats=f                             # write stats to file f
        --stats-time=T                        # write stats every T seconds
        --stats-limit=L                       # limit stats to L entries
* Added [SMTP](src/libmerc/smtp.h) parsing.
* Gathered together most of libmerc's global variables, to enable multiple libmerc instances to be used concurrently.   This makes it possible to update libmerc by loading a newer version of limberc.so. 
* Added the [libmerc_driver](src/libmerc_driver.cc) test program to test concurrent uses of libmerc.

## Version 2.4.0
* Added [batch_gcd](doc/batch-gcd.md), a program for efficiently finding the common factors of RSA public keys.
* Refactored TCP packet processing to use a C++17 `std::variant` for compile-time polymorphism, which enabled considerable code simplification.
* Added [mercury-json-validity-check.sh](test/mercury-json-validity-check.sh) to improve test coverage of mercury's different command line options.

## Version 2.3.6
* Organized all packet processing functions into [libmerc](src/libmerc), a separate library with makefile targets to support both shared objects and a static library.  An interface is defined in [libmerc.h](src/libmerc.h) (with [doxygen-based documentation](doc/mercury.pdf)), which provides a programmatic interface to TLS fingerprinting with destination context.
* Added the initial version of [tls_scanner](src/tls_scanner.cc), a tool for scanning HTTPS servers to obtain certificates, HTTP response headers, and redirect and src= links, and to test for domain fronting.
* Added [cert_analyze](src/cert_analyze.cc), a tool for analyzing X509/PKIX certificates.
* Added command completion for mercury, cert_analyze, and tls_scanner.

## Version 2.3.5
* Optimized the [Naive Bayes classifier for process and malware identification](doc/wnb.md).

## Version 2.3.4
* *Multiple* PCAP files can be piped in to the standard input, like `cat *.pcap | ./mercury`, which can simplify workflow and improve performance, especially when working with HDFS and NFS, by minimizing or eliminating the need to write intermediary files to disk.
* Added defensive coding (no changes in functionality).

## Version 2.3.3
* Improved QUIC processing.
* Added recognition of CONNECT, PUT, and HEAD methods for HTTP fingerprinting.
* Fixed a bug in the --analysis module caused when the fingerprint database contains a count field greater than 2^31.

## Version 2.3.2
* QUIC client fingerprints are now reported.
* PCAP files can be piped in to the standard input, like `cat dhcp.pcap | ./mercury --metadata`.  This feature makes it easier to work with some environments like HDFS.
* Added [documentation](doc/schema.md) for the JSON schema output by mercury.
* New **--nonselected-tcp-data** option writes out the TCP Data field for *non*-selected traffic, as a hex string in the JSON output.  This option provides a view into the TCP data that the --select option does not recognize. The --select filter affects the data written by this option; if you want to see the TCP Data field for all traffic, then '--select=none' on the command line.
* New **--nonselected-udp-data** option, similar to the one above, but for UDP traffic.
* There was a significant refactoring that eliminated much dead code, and flattened the packet-processing code (which is now in `pkt_proc.cc`, which is where you would probably expect to find it).
* Experimental suport for [on-demand TCP reassembly](doc/odtcpr.md).
* Improvements to DNS and DHCP processing and JSON output.
* Added documentation for the [safe parsing strategy](doc/safe-parsing.md) that mercury uses for parsing packets and certificates.

## Version 2.3.0
* New **--resources** command line option causes resource files (used in analysis) to be read from a directory other than the default.  This makes it easier to use a fingerprint prevalence database other than the system default one.
* New metadata output: SSH KEX INIT message and TCP initial sequence number (that is, the SEQ of the TCP SYN packet).
* The packet processing logic has been refactored to use a more systematic approach to packet parsing, which is documented in [doc/safe-parsing](https://github.com/cisco/mercury/blob/master/doc/safe-parsing.md).  The new code is considerably easier to read and extend; it is utilized by the JSON output path, though some functions from the old lower-level approach to packet parsing is still in place in the PCAP output path.

## Version 2.2.0
* New **--metadata** command line option causes JSON output to include a lot more metadata in its output: tls.client.version, tls.client.random, tls.client.session_id, tls.client.cipher_suites, tls.client.compression_methods, tls.client.server_name, tls.server.random, tls.server.certs, http.request.method, http.request.uri, http.request.protocol, http.request.host, and http.request.user_agent.
*  Accomodating the richer metadata required changes to the previous JSON schema.  The current schema is documented in [json-test.py](test/json-test.py).

## Version 2.1.0
* TLS certificates can optionally be output in detail as a JSON object, with the **--certs-json** command.
* Experimental: DNS responses can optionally be output in detail as a JSON object, with the **--dns-json** command.   The JSON schema used with this feature is likely to change.
* The --select (or -s) command now accepts an optional argument that specifies one or more protocols to select.  The argument --select=tls,dns causes mercury to process only TLS and DNS packets, for instance.
* Added support for VXLAN and MPLS
* Per-packet output is no longer supported
